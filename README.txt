Team,

This is a readme file to start off the project. In order for everyone to contribute to the project code-wise everyone needs to download Android Studio. I created the project in our bitbucket folder. To clone it on your local machine you should do the following:

1) Pull first to take account all changes to the repository.
2) Open Android studio -> Open an existing Android Studio project -> Click on the whole folder 'drexel_sphere' and press Open.
3) A couple issues will come up: 
Failed to find build tools revision ... double click and it should automatically start downloading files. 
Next is NDK not configured ... double click and more files should start downloading. 
Next is Unable to get the Cmake version ... Open android studio settings(preferences) -> using the search bar type 'android sdk' (it should be under system settings) -> click on the SDK Tools tab/ drop down -> click on CMake -> press ok, a pop up will ask if you're ok with installing more files. 
Next, studio might not be able to locate 'app.iml' to fix this you should close studio and reopen it using the 'Open' option.
Lastly, Unregistered VCS ... you need to configure this. To do so you press configure, click show directories and show changes in last... and press ok.  

** These changes all occur on your local machine and are separate from the app files excluding the app.iml issue. **

Reach out if you have any other issues if you can not Google a solution.
For the time being I would start looking through the documents Google made available for developers to learn how to use Android Studio and how to build an app:
https://developer.android.com/training/index.html

The following is Google's API to implementing Google Maps:

See you next time.
